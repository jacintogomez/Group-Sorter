# Group-Sorter

To run, drag the .html file into a web browser

This is a simple HTML/CSS/JavaScript file to randomly sort a list of names into two groups. I made this before I was even thinking of going for a Master's degree in CS and when I was still very new to coding, so the format is not as efficient as it could be.
